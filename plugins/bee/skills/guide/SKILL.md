# Bee Mastery Guide

This guide teaches you to use Bee intelligently -- when to suggest commands, what to recommend proactively, and what to never do. Complements `do.md` (keyword matching) and `help.md` (command reference) with workflow intelligence.

## 1. Workflow Decision Tree

### Spec-Level States

| Spec Status | Condition | Suggest | Why |
|-------------|-----------|---------|-----|
| NO_SPEC | No uncommitted changes | `/bee:new-spec` | Start a new feature |
| NO_SPEC | Uncommitted changes | `/bee:review-implementation` | Review existing work first |
| SPEC_CREATED | -- | `/bee:plan-phase 1` | Plan the first phase |
| IN_PROGRESS | See phase table below | (varies) | Phase-dependent |
| COMPLETED | -- | `/bee:complete-spec` | Run completion ceremony |
| ARCHIVED | -- | `/bee:new-spec` | Start fresh |

### Phase-Level Substates (within IN_PROGRESS)

| Phase Status | Suggest | Notes |
|--------------|---------|-------|
| PENDING | `/bee:plan-phase N` | Must plan before execute |
| PLANNED | `/bee:plan-review` | Review plan quality first |
| PLAN_REVIEWED | `/bee:execute-phase N` | Ready to build |
| EXECUTING | `/bee:execute-phase N` | Resume interrupted execution |
| EXECUTED | `/bee:review` | Per-phase review (NOT review-implementation) |
| REVIEWING | `/bee:review` | Resume interrupted review |
| REVIEWED | `/bee:test` | Generate test scenarios |
| TESTING | `/bee:test` | Resume testing |
| TESTED | `/bee:commit` | All verified, safe to commit |
| COMMITTED | `/bee:plan-phase N+1` | Next phase, or complete-spec if last |

### Multi-Phase Intelligence

| Condition | Suggest | Why |
|-----------|---------|-----|
| 3+ phases remain unplanned | `/bee:plan-all` | Batch plan saves time |
| All phases PLAN_REVIEWED | `/bee:autonomous` or `/bee:ship` | Batch execute with review loops |
| Urgent bug mid-execution | `/bee:insert-phase N.1` | Decimal phase insertion |
| Multiple independent features | `/bee:workspace new` | Parallel worktrees |
| All phases COMMITTED | `/bee:complete-spec` | Full ceremony (audit + changelog + tag + archive) |

## 2. Command Reference by Intent

### Start Something
| Intent | Command | When |
|--------|---------|------|
| New feature (vague idea) | `/bee:discuss` then `/bee:new-spec` | Explore before defining |
| New feature (clear requirements) | `/bee:new-spec` | Requirements already known |
| Quick bug fix or small change | `/bee:quick` | Single-phase fast loop |
| Defer an idea for later | `/bee:seed` | Capture with trigger conditions |

### Plan Work
| Intent | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Break phase into tasks | `/bee:plan-phase N` |
| Review plan quality | `/bee:plan-review` |
| Plan all remaining phases | `/bee:plan-all` |
| Add phase to spec | `/bee:add-phase` |
| Insert urgent phase mid-spec | `/bee:insert-phase N.1` |
| UI design contract | `/bee:ui-spec` |

### Build
| Intent | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Execute planned phase | `/bee:execute-phase N` |
| Run everything hands-free | `/bee:autonomous` (plan+execute+review per phase) |
| Execute + review + commit all | `/bee:ship` (for PLAN_REVIEWED phases) |
| Work on two features at once | `/bee:workspace new {name}` |

### Review and Fix
| Intent | Command | Scope |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Per-phase code review | `/bee:review` | Single phase |
| Multi-agent deep review | `/bee:swarm-review` | Segmented parallel |
| Cross-phase compliance | `/bee:review-implementation` | All executed phases |
| Fix confirmed findings | `/bee:fix-implementation` | Apply fixes |
| Visual/UI audit | `/bee:ui-review` | 6-pillar visual |

### Test
| Intent | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Manual test scenarios | `/bee:test` |
| Generate tests from requirements | `/bee:test-gen` |
| E2E Playwright tests | `/bee:test-e2e` |

### Audit
| Intent | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Full 10-agent codebase audit | `/bee:audit` |
| Convert audit to spec | `/bee:audit-to-spec` |
| Spec traceability matrix | `/bee:audit-spec` |

### Debug and Diagnose
| Intent | Command | Use When |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Systematic bug investigation | `/bee:debug` | Complex, multi-symptom bug |
| Stuck/failed workflow diagnosis | `/bee:forensics` | Workflow anomaly, not code bug |
| Project health diagnostics | `/bee:health` | 14-check structural validation |
| Forensics found root cause | Forensics handoff | Transitions to debug with pre-populated symptoms |

### Agent Teams (experimental, opt-in)

Bee supports Claude Code Agent Teams (v2.1.32+, requires `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`). Teams unlock peer-to-peer reviewer debate and scientific-debate debugging at ~7x the token cost of subagents. `/bee:init` and `/bee:update` detect availability and offer opt-in.

**When teams add value (use `--team` flag):**
| Scenario | Command | Why team beats subagent |
|---|---|---|
| Intermittent bug, multi-subsystem error | `/bee:debug --team` | Adversarial hypothesis debate beats single-investigator anchoring bias |
| Pre-merge review of security-critical code | `/bee:swarm-review --team` | Real-time cross-lens dedup; security challenger questions performance verdicts |
| Cross-stack architectural phase planning | `/bee:plan-phase --team` | Architects negotiate contracts upfront before implementation discovers mismatches |
| Large codebase audit (200+ files) | `/bee:audit --team` | Domain-split (auth/payments/reporting) eliminates discipline-overlap noise |

**When subagents are sufficient (no flag — default):**
- Routine post-phase reviews
- Single-file fixes
- Quick tasks
- Sequential dependencies
- Anything where the 7x cost isn't justified by exploration depth

**Auto-mode behavior:** if `agent_teams.allow_in_auto_mode == true` in `.bee/config.json`, `/bee:ship`, `/bee:plan-all`, and `/bee:autonomous` MAY auto-spawn ONE team per run when the operation scores ≥ 70 on the team-decisions scorer (5-axis weighted: hypothesis breadth, cross-layer coverage, independence, uncertainty, stakes). Hard cap: one team per autonomous run (slow shutdown + one-team-per-session limit).

**Anti-patterns:**
- Don't use teams for execute-phase, fix-implementation, or quick (wave/file structure already parallelizes)
- Don't auto-enable teams without measuring cost
- Don't use plan mode unless the architectural decision justifies 7x cost

See `skills/team-decisions/SKILL.md` for full scoring rules, `skills/agent-teams/SKILL.md` for skill bridge mechanism, `skills/team-templates/SKILL.md` for spawn prompt patterns.

### Per-Wave Test Scoping (`/bee:execute-phase`, `/bee:quick`)

After each wave, `/bee:execute-phase` runs **only the tests affected by the wave's changed files** instead of the full suite. Same primitive (`Scoped Test Selection`) is available to `/bee:quick`. Phase-end full suite always runs as the safety net before the phase is marked EXECUTED.

**Per-runner behavior:**

| Runner | Scoping mechanism |
|---|---|
| vitest | Native `vitest related --run` (import-graph) |
| jest | Native `jest --findRelatedTests` (import-graph) |
| pest / phpunit | Filename heuristic (composer.json psr-4 source-root → `{Basename}*Test.php` matches) |
| pytest | Filename heuristic; `-k` form on src-layout |
| `none` / unsupported | Falls back to full suite |

**Config knob:** `phases.post_wave_validation` in `.bee/config.json`:

| Value | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `auto` (default) | Scoped where supported, full elsewhere |
| `full` | Always full (legacy behavior) |
| `scoped` | Always scoped, skip-with-warn if runner unsupported |
| `skip` | No per-wave tests; phase-end full suite is sole validation |

**When to suggest changing it:**
- Suite slow + runner supports scoping → leave `auto` (default)
- Suite very slow AND many waves AND user accepts deferred fail-detection → `skip` (rely entirely on phase-end safety net)
- Suite small (< 30s full run) → `full` (no scoping overhead worth it)

**Anti-patterns:**
- Don't promise users a specific speedup percentage — depends entirely on suite size + wave file count
- Don't disable the phase-end safety net (it always runs regardless of `post_wave_validation`)

See `skills/command-primitives/SKILL.md` Scoped Test Selection for the per-runner command templates and the heuristic mapping rules.

### Session Management
| Intent | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Check progress | `/bee:progress` |
| Auto-suggest next step | `/bee:next` |
| Pause work for later | `/bee:pause` |
| Resume after break | `/bee:resume` |
| Quick note capture | `/bee:note` |
| Cross-session knowledge | `/bee:thread` |
| Save context before compact | `/bee:compact` |
| End of day integrity check | `/bee:eod` |
| View preferences | `/bee:memory` |
| Commit changes | `/bee:commit` |
| Full spec completion ceremony | `/bee:complete-spec` |
| Quick archive (skip ceremony) | `/bee:archive-spec` |
| Manage seed backlog | `/bee:backlog` |

### Setup and Maintenance
| Intent | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Initialize Bee for project | `/bee:init` |
| Update Bee plugin | `/bee:update` |
| View/edit user profile | `/bee:profile` |
| Rebuild codebase context | `/bee:refresh-context` |
| Get help and command list | `/bee:help` |
| Natural language intent routing | `/bee:do` |
| Create custom agent | `/bee:create-agent` |
| Create custom skill | `/bee:create-skill` |

### Dashboard and Visualization
| Intent | Command | When |
|--------|---------|------|
| Open the Bee Hive live dashboard | `/bee:hive` | Reading long reports or plans, browsing seeds/notes, showing workflow to a colleague |
| Stop the Bee Hive dashboard | `/bee:hive stop` | Freeing port 3333 or ending a session cleanly |
| Read a long report visually | `/bee:hive` then click the file in the sidebar | Markdown reports are much more readable in the dashboard's hive-themed viewer than in the terminal |
| Browse phases/notes/seeds/quick tasks at a glance | `/bee:hive` | File tree + tab system gives you fast navigation across all `.bee/` artifacts |
| See phase workflow progress visually | `/bee:hive` then click a phase in the sidebar | Rich phase detail view with progress chain, goal, deliverables, success criteria, requirements, dependencies |
| View the roadmap | `/bee:hive` then click the Roadmap button in the header | Vertical timeline with clickable phase cards that jump to phase detail |

## 3. Smart Feature Suggestions

Proactively suggest these when conditions are met -- don't wait for the user to ask.

### Metrics and Performance
- IF 3+ phases completed: mention bottleneck detection in `/bee:progress`
- IF review iterations > 2 on recent phase: suggest checking metrics for workflow health
- IF execution taking long: mention predictive complexity scoring in plan-phase

### Testing Intelligence
- IF phase reviewed with findings + test coverage unclear: suggest `/bee:test-gen`
- IF building UI phase: suggest `/bee:test-e2e` for Playwright tests
- IF requirements.md shows low test mapping: mention test-gen maps criteria to tests

### Debugging Intelligence
- IF user says "stuck" or "something failed": suggest `/bee:forensics` first (read-only), then `/bee:debug`
- IF debug session resolved root cause: mention pattern extraction (patterns auto-suggested in future)
- IF forensics found CRITICAL/HIGH anomaly: mention handoff to `/bee:debug`

### Workflow Efficiency
- IF all phases planned: suggest `/bee:ship` or `/bee:autonomous` over manual per-phase
- IF multiple unrelated tasks: suggest `/bee:workspace` for parallel worktrees
- IF long session with growing context: mention `/bee:compact` preserves bee state
- IF end of day: suggest `/bee:eod` for integrity check
- IF spec complete: suggest `/bee:complete-spec` (full ceremony) over bare `/bee:archive-spec`

### Idea Capture
- IF user mentions "later" or a tangent: suggest `/bee:seed` with trigger conditions
- IF quick thought: suggest `/bee:note` for zero-friction capture
- IF starting new spec: `/bee:new-spec` auto-surfaces matching seeds

### Review Escalation
- IF single-phase review found many issues: suggest `/bee:swarm-review` for deeper analysis
- IF multiple phases done without cross-phase review: suggest `/bee:review-implementation`

### Dashboard Offer (Bee Hive)

Offer `/bee:hive` proactively whenever the user is about to consume a long-form Markdown artifact that is genuinely more readable in a rendered viewer than in the terminal. The rule is:

- **DO offer** when the user just generated or is about to read: `REVIEW.md`, `AUDIT-REPORT.md`, a phase's `TASKS.md` / `PLAN.md` / `LEARNINGS.md`, an EOD report, a forensic report, a debug session state/report, a discussion note, or the roadmap.
- **DO offer** when the user asks "what's in X?" or "show me Y" for an artifact that is long enough to scroll past 50 terminal lines.
- **DO offer** when the user runs `/bee:progress` or `/bee:health` and the output hints at information the dashboard presents more richly (phase grid, health history trend).
- **DO offer** when the user says things like "hard to read", "cramped", "can you show me visually", or "what's the status across all phases".
- **DO NOT spam** the offer — at most once per conversation per type of artifact. If the user already said "no" to viewing in Hive, don't keep asking.
- **DO NOT offer** for short outputs (a single commit message, a two-line error, a TodoWrite preview). Terminal is faster there.
- **DO NOT offer** when the user is mid-flow in an autonomous pipeline (`/bee:ship`, `/bee:autonomous`) — the offer is noise during long-running work.
- **DO NOT offer** if the user is clearly on a headless/remote machine with no browser.

Format of the offer: "This is long — would you like me to open it in the Bee Hive dashboard at `http://localhost:3333` for a more readable view?" Present it as an option in an AskUserQuestion menu when one is already being shown, or as a plain suggestion at the end of a response otherwise.

If the dashboard is not yet running, `/bee:hive` will start it and open the browser. If it is running, the command reuses the existing server. Users who dislike the dashboard can always say no — the offer is a suggestion, not a block.

**Smart handoff pattern:**

When the user runs a command that produces a file-based report, after displaying the terminal summary add:
> "Full report: `.bee/path/to/report.md`. Want me to open it in the Bee Hive dashboard for a rendered view?"

This pattern turns the dashboard into a natural extension of the terminal workflow without forcing it on anyone.

## 4. Anti-Patterns

1. NEVER auto-commit. User commits via `/bee:commit` only.
2. NEVER suggest `/bee:review-implementation` after a single phase. Use `/bee:review` per phase.
3. NEVER skip review between execute and test. Cycle: execute -> review -> test -> commit.
4. NEVER skip plan-review. Phases should be PLAN_REVIEWED before execute-phase.
5. NEVER write production code without a failing test first. TDD is non-negotiable.
6. NEVER trust conversation memory for state. Read STATE.md and TASKS.md from disk.
7. NEVER auto-approve decision checkpoints. Present options; "Custom" always last.
8. NEVER accumulate context in autonomous. Each phase: fresh subagent, only SUMMARY.md carries forward.
9. NEVER expect LEARNINGS.md in fresh autonomous runs. It requires prior manual reviews.
10. NEVER sort decimal phases lexicographically. Sort numerically: 2, 2.1, 2.2, 3 (not 2, 2.1, 3, 2.2).
11. NEVER run `/bee:ship` on unplanned phases. All must be PLAN_REVIEWED first.
12. NEVER suggest `/bee:compact` or `/clear` as blockers. Execute directly with available context.
13. NEVER run full test suite, linter, or static analysis inside parallel agents. Agents test ONLY their files; conductor validates ONCE per wave (~70% time savings).
14. NEVER push `/bee:hive` during autonomous flows (`/bee:ship`, `/bee:autonomous`) or on short outputs. The dashboard is an opt-in visualization for long-form readers, not a default surface.
15. NEVER suggest `/bee:hive` more than once per conversation for the same artifact type if the user already declined. Respect their preference.

## 5. Ecosystem Model

**Commands -> Agents:** Commands are orchestrators. They read state from disk, validate guards, spawn specialized agents via Task tool. 50 commands orchestrate 36 agents. Agents inherit the parent model unless the conductor explicitly passes `model: "sonnet"` for structured/economy tasks.

**Hooks -> Scripts:** 8 lifecycle events drive 8+ scripts. SessionStart loads project state (load-context.sh) and configures statusline (setup-statusline.js). PostToolUse auto-lints (auto-lint.sh). SubagentStart injects user preferences (inject-memory.sh). SubagentStop validates agent output (per-agent prompts in hooks.json). PreToolUse gates commits (pre-commit-gate.sh). PreCompact saves session context. Stop reminds about unreviewed work. SessionEnd writes session metrics.

**Skills -> Knowledge:** Skills are composable knowledge packs. Core skill provides workflow rules (TDD, disk-is-truth). Stack skills (10 stacks) provide framework conventions. Standards skills (global, frontend, backend, testing) provide universal practices. This guide provides workflow intelligence. Skills load into agent context via frontmatter `skills:` arrays.

**Dashboard (Bee Hive):** A local web dashboard for browsing `.bee/` state in a readable IDE-style layout. Served by a zero-dep Node HTTP server at `plugins/bee/scripts/hive-server.js` bound to `127.0.0.1:3333` and shut down automatically when the owning Claude Code session exits. Exposes three endpoints — `/api/snapshot` (full workflow state aggregator), `/api/config` (write config changes), and `/api/file` (read text files with path-traversal + symlink guards and extension allowlist) — consumed by a React 19 + Vite SPA. Dashboard features: 3-column IDE layout, file tree navigation, tab system with markdown viewer, phase detail cross-reference view, roadmap timeline, split pane, keyboard shortcuts, persistent state via localStorage, inline config toggles. Launch via `/bee:hive`, stop via `/bee:hive stop`. Complements the terminal workflow — never replaces it. See Section 6 (Dashboard Integration) below for when to offer it.

## 6. Dashboard Integration (Bee Hive)

The Bee Hive dashboard is a local web UI (http://localhost:3333) that renders `.bee/` artifacts in a readable IDE-style interface. It's the complement to the terminal — not a replacement, not a requirement, not a block. Treat it as an **opt-in visualization layer** that the user can turn on when they want better readability, and leave off when they're in flow.

### When to offer (signal → action)

| Signal from user or workflow | Offer | Framing |
|---|---|---|
| Just ran `/bee:review` / `/bee:review-implementation` and a REVIEW.md was written | Yes | "Full report: `{path}`. Want to open it in Hive for a rendered view?" |
| Just ran `/bee:audit` and AUDIT-REPORT.md was generated | Yes | "Findings report: `.bee/AUDIT-REPORT.md` — open in Hive for easier browsing?" |
| Just ran `/bee:eod` | Yes | "EOD report written. Open in Hive?" |
| Just ran `/bee:forensics` | Yes | "Forensic report written. Open in Hive for a visual walk-through?" |
| Just ran `/bee:debug` and a session file was written | Yes | "Debug session state at `{path}` — open in Hive?" |
| Just ran `/bee:plan-phase` and TASKS.md was written | Occasionally | Only if the plan is long (>30 tasks) or the user asked to "see" the plan |
| User asks "show me X" or "what's in X" for a long Markdown file | Yes | "It's long — would you like me to open it in the Hive dashboard?" |
| User runs `/bee:progress` or `/bee:health` | Sometimes | Offer if phase count is high or history is deep — "Full phase grid and metrics are visible in the Hive dashboard at http://localhost:3333" |
| User mentions "hard to read", "cramped", "can you show visually" | Yes | "Let me open this in the Hive dashboard for a better view." |
| User is showing work to a colleague / recording a demo | Yes | "Hive gives you a nicer surface to share — want me to open it?" |
| User is mid-autonomous (`/bee:ship`, `/bee:autonomous`) | No | Do not interrupt the flow |
| User just declined a Hive offer in this conversation | No | Respect the preference for the rest of the session |
| Output is 1-10 lines | No | Terminal is faster |
| User is on a headless/remote machine | No | No browser means no dashboard |

### How to offer

Use one of these two formats:

**Format 1 — Inline option in an AskUserQuestion menu** (when a menu is already being shown at the end of the command):

Add "View in Hive dashboard" as one of the options, alongside the existing ones. User picks it → invoke `/bee:hive` which either starts the server or reuses the running instance, then opens the relevant file path in a tab.

**Format 2 — Trailing suggestion** (when no menu is being shown):

End the response with a one-sentence suggestion:
> "Full report saved to `.bee/quick-reviews/2026-04-10-1.md`. Want me to open it in the Bee Hive dashboard for a rendered view?"

Then wait for the user's response. Do not force it.

### What the dashboard can show

When you offer the dashboard, be specific about what the user will see:

- **Phase detail view** — workflow progress chain (plan → review → execute → test → commit), goal, deliverables, success criteria, requirements, dependencies. Cross-referenced from state.phases + snapshot.phases + roadmap mapping.
- **Roadmap timeline** — vertical phase timeline with clickable cards.
- **File viewer** — any `.md`/`.markdown`/`.txt`/`.json`/`.yml`/`.yaml` file under `.bee/` with hive-themed rendering.
- **File tree** — phases, notes, seeds, quick tasks, discussions, forensics, debug sessions, archived specs with live counts.
- **Tab system with split pane** — open multiple files and compare side-by-side.
- **Config editing** — toggle review.against_spec, review.against_standards, review.dead_code, ship.final_review, ship.max_review_iterations, implementation_mode inline.
- **Activity feed** — rolling log of file changes, phase status updates, and metric deltas (polled every 5 seconds).

### Integration with other commands

The dashboard is aware of everything the snapshot aggregator reads. When you want to point the user at something, you can describe the exact path through the UI:

- "Click **Phases** in the sidebar → click **Phase 3: Dashboard SPA** → you'll see the workflow progress chain and deliverables."
- "Click the **Roadmap** button in the header → click **Phase 2** → jumps to the phase detail."
- "Click **Seeds** in the sidebar → click `seed-001.md` → opens the live hooks feed idea with full context."

This lets the user navigate confidently without trial and error.

### Never

- Never start the dashboard inside an autonomous pipeline
- Never assume the dashboard is running — check via `/bee:hive` which handles the already-running case
- Never treat the dashboard as the source of truth — disk state (STATE.md, TASKS.md, config.json) remains authoritative per Rule R4. The dashboard is a view.

## 7. When to Read This Guide

Read this guide when:
- **Session start:** The compact excerpt in load-context.sh gives basic awareness. Read the full guide for decision logic.
- **User seems unsure:** Consult the decision tree (Section 1) to suggest the right next step.
- **User describes intent without naming a command:** Consult the intent map (Section 2).
- **Phase just completed:** Consult the decision tree to know what comes next.
- **Contextual trigger detected:** Check smart suggestions (Section 3) for proactive recommendations.
- **About to take an action:** Check anti-patterns (Section 4) to avoid workflow violations.
- **About to display a long-form Markdown report or artifact:** Check dashboard integration (Section 6) to decide whether to offer `/bee:hive`.
- **User asks "what can Bee do?":** The intent map (Section 2) is the comprehensive capability reference.
