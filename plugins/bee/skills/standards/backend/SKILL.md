# Backend Standards

These standards apply to ALL backend code regardless of framework (Laravel, NestJS, or others). They define stack-agnostic principles -- the "what" and "why" of backend quality. Framework-specific ORM syntax and implementation patterns belong in stack skills.

## API Design

### RESTful Conventions

- **Resource-based URLs** with plural nouns: `/orders`, `/users`, `/products`. Not verbs (`/getOrders`, `/createUser`).
- **HTTP verbs** express the action: `GET` (read), `POST` (create), `PUT` (full replace), `PATCH` (partial update), `DELETE` (remove).
- Nested resources for parent-child relationships: `/orders/{id}/items`. Max 2 levels of nesting.
- Use query parameters for filtering, sorting, and searching: `/orders?status=active&sort=-created_at`.

### Status Codes

Use correct HTTP status codes consistently:

| Code | Meaning           | When to Use                                        |
|------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| 200  | OK                | Successful GET, PUT, PATCH                         |
| 201  | Created           | Successful POST that creates a resource            |
| 204  | No Content        | Successful DELETE with no response body            |
| 400  | Bad Request       | Malformed request syntax, invalid JSON             |
| 401  | Unauthorized      | Missing or invalid authentication credentials      |
| 403  | Forbidden         | Authenticated but insufficient permissions         |
| 404  | Not Found         | Resource does not exist                            |
| 422  | Unprocessable     | Validation failed (well-formed but semantically wrong) |
| 429  | Too Many Requests | Rate limit exceeded                                |
| 500  | Server Error      | Unexpected server failure                          |

### Error Response Format

- Consistent error structure across all endpoints:

```json
{
  "error": "Validation failed",
  "message": "Human-readable explanation of what went wrong",
  "details": {
    "email": ["Email is required", "Email must be a valid email address"],
    "name": ["Name must be at least 2 characters"]
  }
}
```

- Never expose stack traces, SQL errors, or internal paths in error responses.
- Include a machine-readable `error` code and a human-readable `message`.

### Pagination

- **Cursor-based pagination** preferred for real-time data (no skipping/duplicates on data changes).
- **Offset/limit pagination** acceptable for static datasets and admin interfaces.
- Always include metadata: `total`, `per_page`, `current_page` (offset) or `next_cursor` (cursor).
- Default page size: 20-50 items. Allow client to override within a maximum (e.g., max 100).

### Rate Limiting

- Protect expensive endpoints (search, file upload, auth) with rate limits.
- Return `429 Too Many Requests` with `Retry-After` header when limit is hit.
- Rate limits by IP for unauthenticated routes, by user/token for authenticated routes.
- Document rate limits in API documentation.

### Versioning

- URL prefix versioning: `/api/v1/`, `/api/v2/`. Simple, explicit, easy to route.
- Only introduce a new version for breaking changes. Non-breaking additions go in the current version.
- Support the previous version for a documented deprecation period.

### Request/Response Contracts

- **Always validate input.** Every endpoint validates its request body, query parameters, and path parameters.
- **Always type output.** Response shapes are defined by DTOs or resource classes, not raw database objects.
- Document all endpoints with request/response schemas (OpenAPI/Swagger or equivalent).

## Database

### Timestamps

- `created_at` and `updated_at` on ALL tables. No exceptions.
- Use database-level defaults for `created_at`. Use triggers or ORM hooks for `updated_at`.
- Store timestamps in UTC. Convert to local timezone only in the presentation layer.

### Foreign Key Constraints

- Always define foreign key constraints at the database level. Never rely solely on application-level enforcement.
- Use `ON DELETE CASCADE` for child records that have no meaning without the parent (e.g., order items).
- Use `ON DELETE RESTRICT` for records that should prevent parent deletion (e.g., orders referencing a user).
- Use `ON DELETE SET NULL` for optional relationships where the child can exist independently.

### Indexes

- Add indexes on columns used in `WHERE`, `JOIN`, `ORDER BY`, and `GROUP BY` clauses.
- Composite indexes for queries that filter on multiple columns. Column order matters -- most selective first.
- Unique indexes for business constraints (email, slug, external ID).
- Do not over-index: each index slows writes. Only index columns that appear in frequent queries.

### Relationships

- Define relationships explicitly in the schema. The database enforces data integrity, not the application.
- Name foreign keys consistently: `{referenced_table_singular}_id` (e.g., `user_id`, `order_id`).
- Junction tables for many-to-many: `{table_a}_{table_b}` in alphabetical order (e.g., `order_product`).

### Soft Deletes vs Hard Deletes

- **Soft deletes** (a `deleted_at` timestamp column) for user-facing records that may need recovery: users, orders, documents.
- **Hard deletes** for truly disposable data: logs, temporary tokens, expired sessions.
- When using soft deletes, add a global scope/filter to exclude deleted records by default.

### Identifiers

- **UUIDs** for user-facing IDs exposed in URLs and APIs. Prevents enumeration attacks and simplifies multi-system data merging.
- **Auto-increment integers** acceptable for internal IDs that never appear in APIs (pivot table IDs, log entries).
- Never expose auto-increment IDs in public-facing URLs.

### Naming Conventions

- **snake_case** for all column names and table names.
- **Plural** for table names: `orders`, `users`, `order_items`.
- **Singular** for model/entity class names: `Order`, `User`, `OrderItem`.
- Boolean columns prefixed with `is_` or `has_`: `is_active`, `has_discount`.

## Migrations

### Reversible

- ALWAYS include rollback logic (down/rollback method). Every migration must be reversible.
- Test rollbacks in development before deploying. A migration that cannot roll back is a liability.

### Small and Focused

- One concern per migration: create a table, add a column, create an index. Not multiple unrelated changes.
- Small migrations are easier to review, easier to debug, and safer to roll back.

### Zero-Downtime

- **Add before use:** Add new columns/tables in one deployment, start using them in the next.
- **Remove after unused:** Stop using columns/tables in one deployment, remove them in the next.
- Never rename a column in a single migration -- add new, migrate data, remove old (three-step).
- Default values for new non-nullable columns to avoid breaking existing rows.

### Naming

- Descriptive migration names that explain the change: `create_orders_table`, `add_status_to_orders`, `remove_legacy_role_column_from_users`.
- Timestamp-prefixed for ordering (most frameworks do this automatically).

### Data Migrations

- Separate data migrations from schema migrations. Schema changes and data transformations have different risk profiles.
- Data migrations should be idempotent -- safe to run multiple times.
- Never modify a deployed migration. Create a new migration for corrections.

## Query Optimization

### No N+1

- Always eager load relationships when accessing related data in loops or collections.
- The pattern: fetching a list of orders then lazily loading items for each order = N+1 queries (1 for orders + N for items).
- The fix: eager load `orders` with `items` in a single query using the ORM's eager loading mechanism.
- Monitor for N+1 in development using query logging or debug tools.

### Caching

- Cache expensive queries: configuration data, rarely-changing reference data, computed aggregates.
- Use appropriate cache TTL: short (1-5 min) for dynamic data, long (1-24 hours) for stable data.
- Invalidate cache when underlying data changes. Stale cache is worse than no cache.
- Cache at the right level: query-level for specific data, response-level for full API responses.

### Query Logging

- Enable query logging in development to spot slow queries and N+1 patterns.
- Set a slow query threshold (e.g., 100ms) and log queries that exceed it.
- Review query counts per request. A single page load should not generate more than 10-20 queries.

### Index Verification

- Use `EXPLAIN` (or equivalent) to verify queries use indexes as expected.
- A full table scan on a large table is a performance bug. Add an index or restructure the query.
- Check index usage after adding new query patterns or filters.

### Batch Operations

- Use bulk insert/update for large data sets. Never loop and save individual records.
- Chunked processing for very large datasets: process in batches of 100-1000 records.
- Avoid loading entire tables into memory. Use cursor/chunked iteration.

### Connection Pooling

- Use connection pools in production. Each request should not open a new database connection.
- Configure pool size based on expected concurrency and database limits.
- Release connections promptly -- long-running transactions hold connections.

### Avoid

- **SELECT * ** -- select only the columns you need. Reduces memory and network overhead.
- **Unbounded queries** -- always paginate. A query without a limit is a time bomb.
- **Raw SQL in application code** -- use the ORM. Raw SQL bypasses type safety, parameter binding, and portability.
- **Queries in loops** -- batch or eager load instead. One query in a loop of 100 items = 100 queries.
