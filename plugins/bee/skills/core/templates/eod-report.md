<!-- EOD Report Template
  Field semantics:
  {DATE}                = Report date in YYYY-MM-DD format
  {INTEGRITY_STATUS}    = CLEAN (all checks pass) or ISSUES (any check fails)
  {INTEGRITY_FINDINGS}  = Bullet list of integrity check results from integrity-auditor
  {CODE_STATUS}         = CLEAN (no findings) or N FINDINGS (count of code quality issues)
  {CODE_FINDINGS}       = Bullet list of code quality findings from reviewer agent
  {TEST_STATUS}         = HEALTHY (all pass, no gaps) or ISSUES (failures, gaps, or stale tests)
  {PASS_COUNT}          = Number of passing tests
  {FAIL_COUNT}          = Number of failing tests
  {STALE_COUNT}         = Number of stale tests (referencing deleted/renamed code)
  {GAP_COUNT}           = Number of acceptance criteria without corresponding tests
  {GAP_DETAILS}         = Bullet list of specific coverage gaps
  {COMPLIANCE_STATUS}   = ON TRACK (all requirements met) or GAPS (missing/partial requirements)
  {COMPLIANCE_SUMMARY}  = Per-phase compliance status from project-reviewer
  {FILE_COUNT}          = Number of uncommitted files from git status
  {UNCOMMITTED_FILE_LIST} = Bullet list of uncommitted file paths
  {ACTION_ITEMS}        = Numbered list of specific actionable items derived from all 4 audits

  Each section corresponds to one audit agent's output:
  - State Integrity    -> integrity-auditor agent
  - Code Quality       -> reviewer agent (existing, reused)
  - Test Health        -> test-auditor agent
  - Spec Compliance    -> project-reviewer agent

  The EOD command replaces all placeholders after all 4 agents complete.
  Date format is YYYY-MM-DD.
  Running EOD twice on the same day overwrites the previous report (same filename).
