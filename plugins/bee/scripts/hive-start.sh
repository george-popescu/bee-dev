#!/usr/bin/env bash
# hive-start.sh — Launch the Bee Hive dashboard server in the background.
#
# Responsibilities:
#   1. Discover .bee/ (via --bee-dir or by walking up from pwd).
#   2. Probe any existing .bee/.hive-pid — if the PID is alive, emit
#      {"status":"already_running","pid":N} and exit non-zero. DO NOT kill
#      live instances (hive-stop.sh is the only script allowed to terminate).
#      If the PID is dead, remove the stale file and proceed.
#   3. Resolve the owner PID (grandparent of this script — the Claude session
#      shell). $PPID is the ephemeral shell that ran us; the session is its
#      parent. Fall back to $PPID if the grandparent lookup returns empty or
#      PID 1 (init).
#   4. Launch `node hive-server.js` in the background via nohup + disown,
#      redirecting stdout/stderr to .bee/.hive.log and passing HIVE_OWNER_PID
#      so the server can tie its lifetime to the owning session.
#   5. Poll .hive.log for the anchored JSON marker '"type":"server-started"'
#      up to 20 iterations at 0.1s each (2 seconds total). On detection,
#      verify the PID is still alive via `kill -0` (reaper environments kill
#      detached processes shortly after backgrounding).
#   6. Print the server-started JSON line and exit 0 on success, or emit a
#      {"status":"failed",...} JSON and exit non-zero on timeout.
#
# Zero dependencies beyond standard bash + ps + grep + node.
