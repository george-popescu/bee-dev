# Bee - Spec-Driven Development Workflow

A Claude Code plugin that enforces disciplined, spec-driven development with TDD, parallel agent execution, multi-stack support, interactive flow control, review gates, and comprehensive code auditing.

## What Bee Does

Bee structures your development workflow into a lifecycle: **Spec > Plan > Execute > Review > Test > Commit**. Each step produces artifacts on disk, every feature goes through review gates, and 33 specialized agents handle different aspects of the work — including 11 dedicated audit agents for deep codebase analysis.

## Commands (28)

### Setup & Navigation
| Command | Args | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `/bee:init` | | Initialize Bee for a project — detect stack, create `.bee/`, configure workflow, enable notifications |
| `/bee:progress` | | Show project state, phase progress, and suggest next action |
| `/bee:resume` | | Resume work from previous session with full context restoration |
| `/bee:compact` | | Smart compact — preserve bee context, then compress conversation |
| `/bee:memory` | | View and manage user preferences (`.bee/user.md`) |
| `/bee:refresh-context` | | Re-run codebase context extraction, overwriting CONTEXT.md with fresh analysis |
| `/bee:create-agent` | `[agent-name]` | Create a custom project-local agent extension for bee |

| `/bee:audit-to-spec` | `[--critical] [--high] [--all] [--dry-run]` | Convert audit findings into actionable specs — groups by severity, generates spec descriptions for `/bee:new` |

## Workflows

### Full Feature Workflow (Spec to Done)

```
1. /bee:init                    # One-time project setup (stack detection, notifications, context extraction)
2. /bee:discuss                 # Optional: brainstorm ideas before formal spec
3. /bee:new-spec                # Adaptive discovery, spec-writer, spec-review loop
4. /bee:plan-phase 1            # 3-pass planning (decompose → research → waves) + auto-fix review loop
5. /bee:execute-phase 1         # Parallel TDD implementation (wave-based)
6. /bee:review                  # 4-agent review + validate + auto-fix
7. /bee:test                    # Manual test scenarios
8. /bee:test-e2e                # Optional: Playwright E2E tests
9. /bee:commit                  # Reviewed commit
   --- repeat steps 4-9 for each phase ---
10. /bee:review-implementation  # Final spec compliance check (5 agents including audit-bug-detector)
11. /bee:archive-spec           # Archive and reset
```

### Autonomous Pipeline Workflow (Walk Away)

```
1. /bee:init                    # One-time setup
2. /bee:new-spec                # Adaptive discovery + spec creation
3. /bee:plan-all                # Plan ALL phases + cross-plan consistency review (autonomous)
4. /bee:ship                    # Execute all → review each → final review (fully autonomous)
   --- walk away, come back to shipped feature ---
5. /bee:commit                  # Review decision log, commit
```

`/bee:ship` is fully autonomous: zero AskUserQuestion during pipeline, structured decision logging, optimistic continuation on max review iterations, resumable after crash. Cross-plan review catches inter-phase bugs (data contract mismatches, dependency chain breaks) that per-phase reviews miss.

### Quick Task Workflow (No Spec)

```
/bee:quick fix the login button alignment     # TDD default (researcher + implementer agents)
/bee:quick --fast fix the button color         # Direct mode (inline, no agents)
/bee:quick --amend 3                           # Modify existing quick task plan #3
/bee:quick --review refactor auth middleware    # Execute + 4-agent review before commit
```

### Code Audit Workflow (Vibecoded Project Takeover)

```
1. /bee:init                                   # Initialize Bee on the inherited project
2. /bee:audit                                  # Full 9-agent parallel audit
   --- 9 specialists scan → validator filters → report generated ---
3. /bee:audit-to-spec                          # Convert findings into specs by severity
   --- CRITICAL → individual specs, HIGH → grouped, MEDIUM → cleanup, LOW → consolidated ---
4. /bee:new --from-discussion .bee/audit-specs/critical-{slug}.md   # Fix critical issues first
5. /bee:plan-phase 1 → execute → review → test → commit             # Standard Bee pipeline per fix
```

Selective auditing:
```
/bee:audit --only security,database            # Run specific audit agents only
/bee:audit --skip-validation                   # Skip hallucination filtering (faster)
/bee:audit-to-spec --critical                  # Generate specs for CRITICAL findings only
/bee:audit-to-spec --dry-run                   # Preview what specs would be created
```
