/**
 * useActivityFeed — accumulates `ActivityEvent[]` from successive snapshots.
 *
 * Behaviour (T4.4 contract):
 *   - Accepts BOTH the latest snapshot and the connection status from
 *     `useSnapshot` (T3.4). The snapshot alone is not sufficient because
 *     T3.4 retains the last good snapshot during a `disconnected` state, so
 *     this hook needs the explicit status to detect a reconnect and force a
 *     re-baseline.
 *
 *   - Maintains a baseline snapshot in a ref (`useRef<Snapshot | null>`).
 *     The baseline is the snapshot we last diffed against; we only call
 *     `diffSnapshots` when a NEW snapshot timestamp arrives, never on
 *     incidental React re-renders.
 *
 *   - Effect logic (in order):
 *       1. If `connectionStatus === 'disconnected'`, reset the baseline ref
 *          to `null`. This is the critical reconnect guard: when the next
 *          snapshot eventually arrives, the hook will treat it as a fresh
 *          baseline (step 3) instead of diffing against a stale snapshot
 *          captured before the outage. Without this reset the feed would
 *          flood with phantom "added/removed" events the moment the server
 *          comes back online.
 *       2. If `snapshot === null`, return early — nothing to do until the
 *          first payload lands.
 *       3. If `prevRef.current === null`, seed the baseline with this
 *          snapshot and return WITHOUT emitting any events. The first
 *          snapshot is treated as ground truth, mirroring `diffSnapshots`'
 *          own baseline contract (which returns `[]` for a null `prev`).
 *       4. If `snapshot.timestamp !== prevRef.current.timestamp`, diff the
 *          two snapshots, prepend the new events to the accumulated buffer,
 *          and slice the buffer down to `DIFF_SNAPSHOTS_MAX_EVENTS`. Then
 *          advance the baseline ref to the new snapshot.
 *
 *   - Ring buffer: events are stored newest-first. The cap is enforced via
 *     `[...newEvents, ...prev].slice(0, DIFF_SNAPSHOTS_MAX_EVENTS)`. If a
 *     single tick produces more than the cap (e.g. a huge initial sync), the
 *     slice keeps only the first MAX newEvents and drops the prior buffer
 *     entirely — this matches the cap semantics defined in T4.1.
 *
 *   - The returned array is treated as read-only by consumers; the hook owns
 *     the buffer state and never accepts external mutation.
 *
 *   - Pure logic only — no DOM access, no `window` access, no timers. The
 *     hook is fully driven by its inputs and is therefore SSR-safe.
