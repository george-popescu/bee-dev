description: Show available bee commands and usage reference
argument-hint: "[command-name]"
---

## Instructions

You are running `/bee:help` -- the command reference for BeeDev. This command does NOT require `.bee/` initialization. It reads command files directly from the plugin directory.

### Step 1: Determine Mode

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:
- If empty -> **OVERVIEW** mode (show all commands grouped by category)
- If contains a command name -> **DETAIL** mode (show that command's details)

---

### OVERVIEW Mode

Use the Glob tool to discover all files matching `commands/*.md`. For each file, read the frontmatter to extract the `description` field.

Display commands grouped into these categories. For each command, show its name and description from frontmatter. Commands with hardcoded descriptions below (debug, forensics, health, workspace) use those static descriptions intentionally — do NOT read frontmatter for those. All other `{description}` placeholders must be substituted from frontmatter. Format as:

```

```

If a command listed in a category does not have a matching file in `commands/`, skip it silently. If a command file exists but is not listed in any category above, add it to an "Other" group at the end.

After the grouped list, display:

```
{total} commands available. Run `/bee:help {command}` for detailed usage.
```

---

### DETAIL Mode

1. Normalize the command name: strip any leading `/bee:` or `bee:` prefix. For example, `/bee:help bee:execute-phase` normalizes to `execute-phase`.

2. Check if `commands/{name}.md` exists using the Read tool. If not found:
   - Display: "Unknown command: {name}. Run `/bee:help` to see all commands."
   - Stop.

3. Read the command file. Extract from frontmatter:
   - `description` field
   - `argument-hint` field (may be empty)

4. Display:

```
Command: /bee:{name}
Description: {description}
Usage: /bee:{name} {argument-hint}

---

{First 25 lines of the Instructions section}

---

Full command source: commands/{name}.md
```

To extract the Instructions section: find the line starting with `## Instructions` and take the next 25 lines. If no `## Instructions` heading exists, take the first 25 lines after the frontmatter closing `---`.

If the instructions excerpt is cut off (more content follows), append: "... (truncated, see full source)"

**Design Notes (do not display to user):**

- /bee:help is purely informational. No AskUserQuestion needed -- output only.
- Command files are read at runtime so help stays current as commands are added.
- Category grouping is hardcoded for consistent ordering. When new commands are added, update the category list in this file.
- No agents needed. Pure command logic with Glob and Read.
- No state loading needed. Works without .bee/ initialization.
