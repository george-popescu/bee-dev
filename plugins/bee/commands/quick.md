description: Execute a quick task without the full spec pipeline — just describe, execute, commit
argument-hint: "[--fast] [--review] [--amend] [task description]"
---

## Current State (load before proceeding)

Read these files using the Read tool:
- `.bee/STATE.md` — if not found: NOT_INITIALIZED
- `.bee/config.json` — if not found: use `{}`
- `.bee/PROJECT.md` — if not found: skip (project index not available)

Read `config.implementation_mode` and store as `$IMPLEMENTATION_MODE`. If not set, defaults to `"premium"`. Valid values: `"economy"`, `"quality"`, `"premium"`, `"max-critical"`, `"max"` (max tiers per `skills/command-primitives/SKILL.md` Model Selection; unrecognized values behave as premium). Per-agent model resolution follows the rule below.

See `skills/command-primitives/SKILL.md` Model Selection (Reasoning).
Inputs: `$IMPLEMENTATION_MODE`. Apply to implementer / reviewer / validator agents.

## Instructions

You are running `/bee:quick` -- the fast-track command for small tasks that don't need the full spec > plan > execute > review pipeline. Think bug fixes, config tweaks, small refactors, dependency updates. Follow these steps in order.

### Step 1: Validation Guard

See `skills/command-primitives/SKILL.md` Validation Guards.
Apply: NOT_INITIALIZED. No spec or phase is required for quick tasks.

### Step 2: Parse Arguments

Check `$ARGUMENTS` for flags and task description.

1. **Check for `--fast` flag.** If present, store `$USE_FAST = true` and remove the flag from the remaining text.
2. **Check for `--amend` flag.** If present, store `$AMEND = true` and remove the flag from the remaining text. Check if the next token is a number -- if so, store it as `$AMEND_NUMBER` and remove it from the remaining text. If no number follows `--amend`, set `$AMEND_NUMBER = null` (will resolve to latest quick task).
3. **Check for `--review` flag.** If present, store `$USE_REVIEW = true` and remove the flag from the remaining text. Otherwise `$USE_REVIEW = false`. Also check `config.json` for `quick.review` setting -- if true, set `$USE_REVIEW = true` regardless of flag.
4. **Determine `$USE_FAST` (if not already set by `--fast`):**
   - If `--fast` was present, `$USE_FAST = true` (already set above).
   - Otherwise, check `config.json` for `quick.fast` setting -- if `true`, set `$USE_FAST = true`. If `false` or not set, set `$USE_FAST = false`.
   - Default when no flag and no config: `$USE_FAST = false` (TDD path is default).
5. **If `$AMEND` is true**, jump to Step 2a (Amend Flow) below.
6. **Get task description.** Use the remaining text after flag removal as `$DESCRIPTION`.
7. If `$DESCRIPTION` is empty, ask the user:

```
What's the quick task? Describe what you want to do.
```

Wait for the user's response. Store as `$DESCRIPTION`.

See `skills/command-primitives/SKILL.md` Conversation Context Capture.
Inputs: live chat after the most recent state-loading command. Apply: filter TIGHT against the single `$DESCRIPTION` (no feature-scope/per-task split — that two-stage shape is multi-task commands only); capture only context that changes this one task.

---

#### Step 2a: Amend Flow

When `--amend` is set:

1. **Resolve task number.** If `$AMEND_NUMBER` is null, read `.bee/STATE.md` and find the LATEST quick task row (highest number). Store as `$AMEND_NUMBER`.
2. **Find plan file.** Look in `.bee/quick/` for a file matching the prefix `{$AMEND_NUMBER zero-padded to 3 digits}-` (e.g., `003-`). Store the resolved path as `$PLAN_FILE`.
3. **If no plan file found**, display: "No plan file found for quick task {N}. Only tasks with plans can be amended." Stop.
4. **Set `$N` to `$AMEND_NUMBER`** (amend preserves the original task number, does not increment).
5. **Read the plan file** and present it to the user:

```
Current plan for quick task {N}:

{plan file contents}

What would you like to change?
```

5. Wait for the user's response. Update the plan file with the requested changes.
6. Set `$DESCRIPTION` from the plan file's title (the `# Quick Task {N}: {DESCRIPTION}` heading).
7. Set `$USE_FAST` and `$USE_REVIEW` from the plan file's metadata (Mode and Review fields). Mode `tdd` maps to `$USE_FAST = false`; Mode `fast` maps to `$USE_FAST = true`.
8. Proceed to Step 4 (Execute), using the amended plan file as context for the implementer.
9. After execution completes, update the plan file's `## Execution Notes` section and set Status to EXECUTED.
10. In Step 6 (Update STATE.md), the single-row replacement handles this naturally — the amended task becomes the latest entry.

---

### Step 3: Confirm Scope

Present the task back to the user:

```
Quick task: {DESCRIPTION}
Mode: {!$USE_FAST ? "tdd (implementer agent with Red-Green-Refactor)" : "fast (direct, no tests)"}
Review: {USE_REVIEW ? "yes (lightweight review before commit)" : "no"}

This will:
1. Implement the changes {!$USE_FAST ? "using TDD implementer agent" : "directly"}
{USE_REVIEW ? "2. Review changes for bugs and standards" : ""}
{USE_REVIEW ? "3" : "2"}. Commit the result
{USE_REVIEW ? "4" : "3"}. Track it in STATE.md

```

```
AskUserQuestion(
  question: "Quick task scope confirmed. Proceed?",
  options: ["Proceed", "Edit scope", "Cancel", "Custom"]
)
```

If "Cancel", stop. If "Proceed", continue. If "Edit scope", let user refine.

### Step 3.5: Persist Plan (TDD mode only)

**Skip this step entirely if `$USE_FAST` is true (fast mode).** Fast mode produces no plan artifacts.

1. Create `.bee/quick/` directory if it doesn't exist.
2. Read `.bee/STATE.md` and parse the `#` column value from the existing single data row in the `## Quick Tasks` table. If a row exists, set `$N` to that number + 1. If no data rows exist, set `$N` to 1.
3. Slugify the description: lowercase, replace spaces with hyphens, strip all characters except `a-z`, `0-9`, and hyphens, collapse consecutive hyphens, trim leading/trailing hyphens, truncate to 50 characters.
4. Write plan file to `.bee/quick/{NNN}-{slug}.md` (3-digit zero-padded number) with this content:

```markdown
# Quick Task {N}: {DESCRIPTION}

- Date: {YYYY-MM-DD}
- Mode: {tdd|fast}
- Review: {yes|no}
- Status: PLANNED

## Description
{DESCRIPTION}

## Conversation Context
{Per `skills/command-primitives/SKILL.md` Conversation Context Capture, write the captured Decisions / Constraints / Ruled-out buckets here when non-empty. Silently omit this section entirely when all buckets are empty.}

## Acceptance Criteria
{Derive 3-8 testable acceptance criteria from the task description. Each criterion should be a concrete, verifiable statement that the implementer can write a test for. Format as a numbered list.}

## Test File Targets
{Based on the description and project structure, list the test file path(s) the implementer should create. Use existing test directory conventions from the project.}

## Pattern References
{List 2-4 existing files in the codebase that the implementer should read as pattern references before writing code. Prioritize files that are structurally similar to what will be created or modified.}

## Research
{To be filled by researcher agent}

## Execution Notes
{To be filled after execution}
```

5. Store the plan file path as `$PLAN_FILE`.

### Step 4: Execute

**If `$USE_FAST` is true (fast mode):** execute directly in main context.

**If `$USE_FAST` is false (default TDD mode):** use the agent pipeline described in Step 4b below.

---

#### Step 4a: Direct Execution (fast mode)

Implement the task directly. Follow these rules:

1. **Read before writing.** Always read existing files before modifying them.
2. **Use the project's stack conventions.** Check `config.json` for the configured stacks. Determine which stack the modified files belong to by comparing file paths against each stack's `path` (a file matches a stack if its path starts with or is within the stack's path; `"."` matches everything). If unclear, use the first stack (`stacks[0]`). Follow the standards for that stack.
3. **Keep it small.** Quick tasks should touch a few files at most. If the task grows beyond ~5 files, suggest the user run `/bee:new-spec` instead.
4. **Resolve per-stack linter.** For the relevant stack, resolve the linter: read `stacks[i].linter` first, fall back to root `config.linter` if absent, then `"none"`. If a linter is configured, run it on modified files after implementation scoped to the stack's path.
5. **Track `$CHANGED_FILES`.** Maintain a running list of every file path you Write or Edit in this turn — this is `$CHANGED_FILES`. If git is available, `git status --porcelain` is the canonical fallback at the end.
6. **Run tests if relevant.** Use `skills/command-primitives/SKILL.md` Scoped Test Selection per stack with `$CHANGED_FILES`, `$MODE = "auto"`. Falls back to the full-stack command via Build & Test Gate when the primitive returns `null`.

After implementation, present a summary:

```
Done. Changes:
- {file1}: {what changed}
- {file2}: {what changed}
...
```

If `$USE_REVIEW` is true, continue to Step 4.5. Otherwise skip to Step 5.

---

#### Step 4b: Agent Execution (default TDD mode)

Use the Task tool to spawn specialized agents. The TDD implementer enforces Red-Green-Refactor with tests written before production code.

**Phase 1: Research**

Spawn the `researcher` agent to understand the codebase area before making changes. Research findings will be persisted to the plan file for traceability.

See `skills/command-primitives/SKILL.md` Model Selection (Scanning).
Inputs: `$IMPLEMENTATION_MODE`. Apply to the researcher (research is scanning work).

```
Task(
  subagent_type="bee:researcher",
  {$IMPLEMENTATION_MODE == "premium" ? '' : 'model="sonnet",'}

  description="Research: {DESCRIPTION}",
  prompt="
    QUICK TASK RESEARCH MODE -- No TASKS.md, no phase context.

    Research the codebase to understand how to: {DESCRIPTION}

    ## Prior Discussion
    {Captured Conversation Context buckets filtered tight against {DESCRIPTION}, per `skills/command-primitives/SKILL.md` Conversation Context Capture. Omit this block when buckets are empty.}

    Project stack: {stack from config.json}

    Find:
    1. Relevant files and their current implementation
    2. Patterns and conventions used in this area
    3. Dependencies and imports that will be affected
    4. Existing tests that cover this area

    Do NOT write to TASKS.md -- return your findings in your final message as a concise
    summary with specific file paths and line numbers.

    Your findings will be persisted to the plan file at {$PLAN_FILE} for future reference.
  "
)
```

Store the research output as `$RESEARCH`.

**Persist research to plan file:** After the researcher returns, read `$PLAN_FILE` and update the `## Research` section with `$RESEARCH` content. Write the updated plan file to disk.

**Research complete — present menu:**

```
AskUserQuestion(
  question: "Research complete. Plan: {$PLAN_FILE}",
  options: ["Execute", "Revise plan", "Custom"]
)
```

- **Execute**: Proceed to spawn quick-implementer agent (Phase 2 below).
- **Revise plan**: Use AskUserQuestion to ask for revision instructions, update the plan file accordingly, then proceed to Phase 2.
- **Custom**: Wait for free-text input from the user and act on it.

**Phase 2: Implementation (TDD)**

Spawn the `quick-implementer` agent with the research context, plan file path, and enriched plan content. The quick-implementer enforces TDD: it reads acceptance criteria from the plan file, writes failing tests first, then implements the minimal code to make tests pass.

**Model selection:** apply the Model Selection (Reasoning) rule referenced at the top of this file (implementer is reasoning-heavy work).

```
Task(
  subagent_type="bee:quick-implementer",
  {$IMPLEMENTATION_MODE == "economy" ? 'model="sonnet",' : ''}
  description="Implement (TDD): {DESCRIPTION}",
  prompt="
    Implement this task using TDD (Red-Green-Refactor): {DESCRIPTION}

    ## Prior Discussion
    {Captured Conversation Context buckets filtered tight against {DESCRIPTION}, per `skills/command-primitives/SKILL.md` Conversation Context Capture. Omit this block when buckets are empty.}

    Project stack: {stack from config.json}
    Linter: {resolved linter for this stack: stacks[i].linter ?? config.linter ?? "none"}
    Test runner: {resolved test runner for this stack: stacks[i].testRunner ?? config.testRunner ?? "none"}

    Plan file: {$PLAN_FILE}
    Read this file for acceptance criteria, test file targets, pattern references,
    and research findings before starting implementation.

    The plan file contains:
    - ## Acceptance Criteria -- drive your test writing from these
    - ## Test File Targets -- create tests at these paths
    - ## Pattern References -- read these files as code patterns to follow
    - ## Research -- context about the codebase area

    Follow the TDD cycle:
    1. RED: Write failing tests based on acceptance criteria
    2. GREEN: Write minimal code to make tests pass
    3. REFACTOR: Clean up with passing tests as safety net

    When done, end with: Task complete. [X] tests passing.
  "
)
```

After the implementer returns, present the summary to the user:

```
Agent execution complete.

Changes:
- {file1}: {what changed}
- {file2}: {what changed}

Tests: {pass/fail summary}
```

**Persist execution notes to plan file:** After the implementer returns, read `$PLAN_FILE` and update the `## Execution Notes` section with a summary of the changes made. Set `Status:` to `EXECUTED`. Write the updated plan file to disk.

If the implementer reported failures or issues, present them and ask the user how to proceed before continuing to Step 4.5.

**Implementation complete — present menu:**

```
AskUserQuestion(
  question: "Implementation complete. [X] tests passing.",
  options: ["Review", "Accept", "Custom"]
)
```

Replace `[X]` with the actual test count from the implementer's final message.

- **Review**: Proceed to Step 4.5 (spawn bug-detector, pattern-reviewer, stack-reviewer, plan-compliance-reviewer).
- **Accept**: Skip review entirely — jump directly to Step 5 (Commit).
- **Custom**: Wait for free-text input from the user and act on it.

### Step 4.5: Review Gate

**Skip this step if `$USE_REVIEW` is false AND the user did NOT explicitly select "Review" in the previous menu.** If the user selected "Review" — even without `--review` flag — execute this step (R6: when user selects an option, execute it).

If `$USE_REVIEW` is true, run a review before committing. The review pipeline uses 4 agents when a plan file exists (TDD mode) or 3 agents when no plan file exists (fast mode). The engine lives in `skills/review-pipeline/SKILL.md` — load it now if not already loaded; the references below execute its sections with the manifest in 4.5.2.

See `skills/command-primitives/SKILL.md` Build & Test Gate (Interactive).
Run per-stack build then user-opt-in tests; on failure prompt the user via AskUserQuestion.

#### 4.5.0: Detect review scope and compute output path

1. Run `git diff --stat` to identify all changed files. Filter to source files only (`.php`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, `.tsx`, `.vue`, `.css`, `.scss`). Store as `$REVIEW_FILES`.
2. Create `.bee/quick-reviews/` directory if it does not exist.
3. Check what files already exist for today's date (YYYY-MM-DD pattern).
4. Set `{review_output_path}` = `.bee/quick-reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-{N}.md` where N is `(existing count for today) + 1`.

#### 4.5.1: Extract false positives

See `skills/review-pipeline/SKILL.md` False-Positive Extraction (Dual-Mode).
Output: `$FP_LIST` — included verbatim in each agent's context packet in 4.5.2.

#### 4.5.15: Context Cache

See `skills/command-primitives/SKILL.md` Context Cache + Dependency Scan.
Read-once cache only (no dependency scan in quick mode -- modified-file scope is too small to need expansion).

#### 4.5.2: Build context packets and spawn agents in parallel

**Review pipeline manifest** (the parameters for EVERY `review-pipeline` section referenced in this review gate):

- `$SCOPE`: `quick`
- `$SCOPE_CONTEXT`: the changed-files list `$REVIEW_FILES` + `Project stack: {stack from config.json}`
- `$OUTPUT_PATH`: `{review_output_path}` from 4.5.0
- `$FP_LIST`: from 4.5.1
- `$ROSTER_GLOBALS` **(flat roster — NOT per-stack):** quick spawns ONE flat agent set using the project's primary stack — `bee:bug-detector`, `bee:pattern-reviewer`, `bee:stack-reviewer`, plus `bee:plan-compliance-reviewer` ONLY in TDD mode (skip if `$USE_FAST` is true — no plan file exists). The plan-compliance packet checks the implementation against `{$PLAN_FILE}`'s `## Acceptance Criteria` section instead of a spec. No audit-bug-detector, no architecture-auditor (no TASKS.md — the gate cannot fire).
- `$BATCH_VALIDATORS`: none
- `$EXPECTED_COUNT`: 4 in TDD mode, 3 in fast mode
- `$VALIDATION_BATCH_SIZE`: 5
- `$ESCALATION`: off
- `$STYLISTIC_MODE`: auto-confirm
- `$LOOP`: off (re-review is offered via the post-review menu)

Execute with the manifest above:

1. See `skills/review-pipeline/SKILL.md` Context Packets. (Quick-scope packets: QUICK REVIEW MODE preamble, changed-files list, "Target 1-3 findings" instruction; the plan-compliance packet reads `{$PLAN_FILE}` and extracts the `## Acceptance Criteria` section.)
2. Spawn all agents via Task tool calls in a SINGLE message (parallel execution). In TDD mode, spawn all 4 agents. In fast mode, spawn only the first 3 agents (no plan-compliance-reviewer -- no plan file exists). Apply the Model Selection (Reasoning) rule referenced at the top of this file to every agent. Wait for all agents to complete.

#### 4.5.3: Parse findings from each agent

See `skills/review-pipeline/SKILL.md` Parse Findings.
(Plan Compliance Reviewer findings apply in TDD mode only.)

#### 4.5.4: Deduplicate and merge

See `skills/review-pipeline/SKILL.md` Deduplicate and Merge (Rules 0–3).

#### 4.5.5: Assign IDs and write REVIEW.md

See `skills/review-pipeline/SKILL.md` Write Report.
Report identity: Spec="Quick Review", Phase="N/A", date, iteration=1, status: PENDING.

#### 4.5.6: Evaluate and present findings

1. If 0 findings after consolidation: display "Quick review: clean!" and proceed to Step 5.

2. Display findings summary: "{N} findings from {agent_count} reviewers: {critical} critical, {high} high, {medium} medium"

3. See `skills/review-pipeline/SKILL.md` Validate Findings (the manifest gates the optional parts: batch size 5, escalation off, no batch validators, stylistic auto-confirm). Classify each finding as REAL BUG / FALSE POSITIVE / STYLISTIC / DROPPED, update the report with the classifications, and handle DROPPED/FALSE POSITIVE per the engine. FP entries persisted from this command use Phase: `Quick Task`.

4. Per `$STYLISTIC_MODE: auto-confirm`: STYLISTIC findings are auto-included as confirmed without per-issue user choice (unlike full `/bee:review` which asks for each). This is intentional -- the quick gate prioritizes speed over granular control.

5. Present confirmed findings (REAL BUG + STYLISTIC) to the user:

```
Quick review found {N} confirmed issue(s):
{For each: F-NNN [severity] category: summary}
```

Use AskUserQuestion:
Question: "Quick review found {N} issue(s). What to do?"
Options: "Fix before commit" (spawn fixers for confirmed issues), "Commit as-is" (acknowledge and proceed), "Cancel" (stop here).

6. Handle user choice:
   - **Fix:** Display the priority-sorted fix order (the engine sorts Critical > High > Standards > Dead Code > other Medium), then:

     See `skills/review-pipeline/SKILL.md` Fix Confirmed Issues (File-Based Parallelism).

     After all findings are processed, display: "{fixed} fixed, {skipped} skipped out of {total}." Then present the post-review menu:

        ```
        AskUserQuestion(
          question: "Review complete. [X] findings: [F] fixed, [FP] false positives.",
          options: ["Re-review", "Accept", "Custom"]
        )
        ```

        Replace `[X]` with total finding count, `[F]` with fixed count, `[FP]` with false positive count.

        - **Re-review**: Re-run all review agents (Steps 4.5.0–4.5.6) on the same `$REVIEW_FILES`. No iteration limit — repeat until user selects Accept or Custom.
        - **Accept**: End review cycle, proceed to Step 5.
        - **Custom**: Wait for free-text input from the user and act on it.

   - **Commit as-is:** Proceed to Step 5.
   - **Cancel:** Display "Cancelled. Changes remain unstaged." Stop.

### Step 5: Commit

1. Run `git diff --stat` and `git status --short` to see all changes.
2. Generate a conventional commit message:
   - `fix({scope}): {description}` for bug fixes
   - `feat({scope}): {description}` for new functionality
   - `refactor({scope}): {description}` for refactors
   - `chore({scope}): {description}` for config, deps, tooling
   - Derive `{scope}` from the primary area affected (module name, feature area, etc.)
3. Present to user:

```
Commit message: {message}

Files to stage:
- {list of changed files}
```

```
AskUserQuestion(
  question: "Commit with this message?",
  options: ["Commit", "Edit message", "Cancel", "Custom"]
)
```

- **Commit:** Stage specific files and commit using heredoc for safe message handling:
  ```bash
  git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
  {message}
  EOF
  )"
  ```
  NEVER use `git add -A` or `git add .`.
- **Edit message:** Wait for user's edited message, then commit with that.
- **Cancel:** Display "Cancelled. Changes are unstaged." Stop.
- **Custom:** Free text.

### Step 6: Update STATE.md

1. Re-read `.bee/STATE.md` from disk (Read-Modify-Write pattern — quick task may have been long-running).
2. Find or create the `## Quick Tasks` section. If it doesn't exist, add it after the Phases table (or after Last Action if no Phases table):

```markdown
## Quick Tasks

| # | Description | Date | Commit |
|---|-------------|------|--------|
```

3. Determine `{N}`: **If `$AMEND` is true**, use `$N` (already set to `$AMEND_NUMBER` in Step 2a — preserve the original task number, do NOT increment). **Otherwise**, parse the `#` column value from the existing single data row: if a row exists (e.g., `| 5 | ... |`), set `{N}` to that number + 1; if no data rows exist, set `{N}` to 1. Get the commit hash: `git rev-parse --short HEAD`.
4. **Replace** all existing data rows in the Quick Tasks table with a SINGLE row for the current task. The table always shows only the latest quick task (old entries are removed — the commit history is the audit trail):

```markdown
| {N} | {DESCRIPTION} | {YYYY-MM-DD} | {commit_hash} |
```

Note: `{N}` still increments (it's the historical task counter), but the table only ever has one row.

5. Update the Last Action section:

```markdown
## Last Action
- Command: /bee:quick
- Timestamp: {ISO 8601}
- Result: Quick task {N}: {DESCRIPTION}
```

6. Write the updated STATE.md.

7. **Touch the focused spec (FIX 6 batch14):** After writing STATE.md, bump the focused active spec's `last_touched` timestamp so quick work participates in active-spec ordering. Check whether a focused active spec exists by reading the `- Path:` line from STATE.md (the line was just written). If the path contains `.bee/specs/` and the derived slug is not `(none)`, run silently:

   ```bash
   node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/specs-cli.js touch --bee .bee --slug <slug>
   ```

   Skip silently if the path is `(none)`, no specs.json exists (legacy single-spec repo), or the touch command exits non-zero (spec not found or terminal). Do NOT block or fail the quick task on any touch error.

### Step 7: Complete

Display:

```
Quick task {N} complete: {DESCRIPTION}
Commit: {commit_hash}
{If $USE_REVIEW was false: "Tip: Use --review flag for a lightweight code review before commit."}
{If $USE_FAST was true: "Tip: TDD mode is the default. Omit --fast for implementer agent with Red-Green-Refactor."}
```

```
AskUserQuestion(
  question: "Quick task {N} complete.",
  options: ["Another quick task", "Progress", "Custom"]
)
```

- **Another quick task**: Ask "What's the next task?" and start a new quick task flow.
- **Progress**: Execute `/bee:progress`
- **Custom**: Free text.

---

**Design Notes (do not display to user):**

- Quick tasks are INDEPENDENT of the spec/phase pipeline. They don't require a spec, don't create phases, and don't go through the full review/test gates.
- Quick tasks are tracked in STATE.md for audit trail purposes.
- NEVER auto-commit. Always show the diff and get explicit user confirmation.
- NEVER use `git add -A`, `git add .`, or destructive git operations.
- If the task seems too large (>5 files, complex architecture changes), recommend `/bee:new-spec` instead.
- The quick task table uses a simple incrementing number (1, 2, 3...) separate from phase numbering. Only the LATEST quick task is shown in the table (old rows are replaced). The incrementing number and commit history serve as the audit trail.
- **Default mode is TDD** (researcher on sonnet + quick-implementer with Red-Green-Refactor on inherit). `--fast` flag switches to direct execution in main context. The `quick.fast` config option controls the override: `true` = fast mode, `false` or not set = TDD mode (default). The `--fast` flag always forces fast mode regardless of config.
- TDD mode research uses the `bee:researcher` agent governed by Model Selection (Scanning) -- research is scanning work. Implementation uses `bee:quick-implementer` governed by Model Selection (Reasoning). Both rules live in `skills/command-primitives/SKILL.md`. All modes enforce the TDD cycle (Red-Green-Refactor).
- `--review` flag enables a review gate before commit. Can also be set permanently via `config.quick.review: true`.
- Review gate uses four specialized agents in TDD mode (bug-detector, pattern-reviewer, stack-reviewer, plan-compliance-reviewer) or three agents in fast mode (no plan-compliance-reviewer -- no plan file exists). The plan-compliance-reviewer operates in CODE REVIEW MODE, checking implementation against the plan file's acceptance criteria.
- All review agents run in parallel via Task tool calls in a single message. Model selection follows the canonical Model Selection (Reasoning) rule referenced at the top of this file.
- Before spawning agents, documented false positives are extracted and included in each agent's context packet so known non-issues are excluded.
- Each agent targets 1-3 findings; combined target is 3-8 findings. Findings are consolidated, deduplicated (same file + line ranges within 5 lines merged), and written to `.bee/quick-reviews/`.
- The standalone `/bee:review-implementation` command (in ad-hoc mode) shares the same agent parallel pattern and can also be used to review quick task changes independently.
- Even in TDD mode, commit confirmation is always done in the main context (never auto-committed by agents).
- **Plan persistence:** In TDD mode, a plan file is written to `.bee/quick/{NNN}-{slug}.md` before execution. The plan captures the task description, acceptance criteria, test file targets, pattern references, research findings, and execution notes. This enables `--amend` and provides an audit trail. Fast mode (`--fast`) skips plan creation entirely -- no `.bee/quick/` artifacts.
- **Plan enrichment:** The plan file in TDD mode includes three enriched sections beyond the basic template: `## Acceptance Criteria` (testable criteria derived from the description), `## Test File Targets` (test file paths for the implementer), and `## Pattern References` (existing files to use as code patterns). These sections are consumed by the `bee:quick-implementer` agent.
- **`--amend` flow:** Allows re-executing a previous quick task with modifications. Reads the existing plan file, lets the user modify it, then re-executes. Only works for tasks that have plan files (TDD mode tasks). Fast mode tasks cannot be amended.
- **User choice gate:** The review gate presents three options via AskUserQuestion: Fix (spawns fixer agents with file-based parallelism for confirmed issues), Commit as-is (proceeds to commit), Cancel (stops). The fixer strategy follows the same pattern as `/bee:fix-implementation`: parallel across files, sequential within the same file.
